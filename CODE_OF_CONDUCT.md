# Code of Conduct - Mooncord

## Our Commitment
We are dedicated to fostering a friendly, safe, and inclusive community for everyone. This includes, but is not limited to, welcoming individuals of all levels of experience, gender identities and expressions, sexual orientations, disabilities, personal appearances, body sizes, races, ethnicities, ages, religions, nationalities, and similar characteristics.

## Expectations for Behavior
1. **Create a Welcoming Environment**:
   - Use aliases or nicknames that are appropriate and avoid anything overtly sexual or potentially offensive.

2. **Be Kind and Respectful**:
   - Treat others with kindness and courtesy. Mean or rude behavior is not acceptable.

3. **Respect Diverse Perspectives**:
   - Understand that opinions may differ, and every design or implementation choice involves trade-offs. There is rarely a single "correct" solution.

4. **Provide Constructive Feedback**:
   - Keep critiques constructive and focused. If you have ideas to experiment with, consider creating a fork to test them.

5. **Avoid Disruptive Behavior**:
   - Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or engaging in other disruptive behavior is not allowed.

## Zero Tolerance for Harassment
We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, including actions or language that demeans, excludes, or marginalizes individuals or groups. This includes public and private interactions.

- **Harassment Definition**: Our interpretation aligns with the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md). Please review their definition for clarity.

If you experience or witness harassment, or feel uncomfortable due to the behavior of another community member, please reach out to a channel operator or any member of the [Mooncord staff](https://discord.gg/3H4tmZpK3z). We are here to support you and ensure the community remains a safe space for everyone.

## Enforcement
We reserve the right to exclude individuals from community interactions if they engage in:
- Insults
- Demeaning language
- Harassment

**Note**: Behavior that targets socially marginalized groups will result in immediate and decisive action.

## Conclusion
Our community thrives on mutual respect, empathy, and collaboration. Letâ€™s work together to ensure Mooncord remains a welcoming and enjoyable environment for all.
